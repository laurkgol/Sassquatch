# Sassquatch
## Why did you choose this subject?
We both enjoy front end development, especially css, and we have heard that Sass is like super-powered css.

## How were you first made aware of it?
We have seen Sass in a lot of job descriptions for front end devs, and have heard it mentioned a lot.

## What problem does it solve?
Sass organizes css code in an intuative way, makes it DRY, and allows for dynamic use of attributes.

## Why does one use it?
Sass is a CSS preprocessor that makes your CSS code cleaner, shorter, and more maintainable. You can assign variables, nest styles, call functions, and use multiple stylesheets. Some alternatives to Sass are Stylus, LESS, and CSS-crush (built with PHP).

## What is the history of this technology?
Sass was designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum and Chris Eppstein. It first appeared in 2006 and is well maintained, with its most recent stable release in December 2016.

## What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
We think it is a really powerful tool that would be useful for really big websites that need to be maintained, and it is easy to reassign a variable without having to change things one-by-one by searching through all the CSS.

## What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?

## What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?
-What is the purpose of Mixins?
-What can you assign to variables in Sass?
-What is the sytax for assigning variables? 

# Sass Tools

Nesting:
-makes media queries and selectors(like :hover) more organized

Variables:
-Assign variables to things like colors and fonts so if your branding changes you can change everything automatically

Mixins: reusable sets of properties, these can also contain nested rules (like functions)
